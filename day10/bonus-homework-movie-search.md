## PYTH02 BONUS HOMEWORK CHALLENGE: themoviedb

1. Work out the correct URL to search themoviedb.org API for movies by text query ([RTFM](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3))
2. Write a python script which asks the user for a search string and uses the URL from (1) to display the matching search results, including title, year, and first 140 characters of the synopsis.
3. Number each result from (2) and ask the user to type a number to see full movie details for that result. RTFM to find the URL for getting full movie details by ID (each result from the search has its own ID). Show whatever detail you want from the full details response.
4. In the details output above, work out how to construct the URL for the movie poster and print it in the terminal along with the other details for the movie.
